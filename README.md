# console-finances

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create code that analyses financial records of a company by providing the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of profits/losses, the average of the changes in profit, the greatest increase in profit and the greatest decrease in losses over the entire period. I learnt and practised how to find the sum of an array, syntax used to round to 2 decimal places, and using object to store two properties within one variable.

## Usage
In order to see the financial analysis, access Chrome DevTools to inspect the console.

To store two propeties within one variables I used object: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object
